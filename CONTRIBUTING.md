## Code Style & Tools

- **Go code**
    - Use `gofmt` or `goimports`

- **React code**
    - Lint
    - Functional components only, please

Keep functions small and focused. Avoid magic or clever abstractions that reduce clarity.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Stick to one feature or fix per PR.
- Update or add tests when applicable.
- If your change affects the UI, include screenshots or a short description of the result.
- Add helpful commit messages (e.g. `fix: prevent crash on empty config`).

---

## Reporting Issues

When submitting an issue:
- Check if it already exists.
- Provide a clear, reproducible example.
- Include logs, screenshots, or environment details if possible.

Use the following labels when opening issues (if applicable):
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `help wanted`
